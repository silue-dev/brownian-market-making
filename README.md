# Market Making Algorithm Implementation

This project serves as a playground for implementing a market making algorithm for High-Frequency Trading. The (final) model implemented in this project is the Avellaneda-Stoikov model. The research paper by Avellaneda and Stoikov can be accessed [here](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=93e392c5b2765e6691b8acb60cd4a7e975bf1d6a). 

To execute the code, simply run:

```
python src/main.py
```

## Result
The images below depict a simulation run of the market maker.
